The White House slammed Amazon for reportedly planning to display the cost of President Donald Trump’s tariffs next to the total price of products on its site.
“This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a press briefing with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.
Amazon later clarified that the plan to show tariff surcharges was “never approved” and is “not going to happen.”
Trump personally called Bezos on Tuesday morning to express his displeasure about the initial report that spurred the heated response from the White House.
